.SH NAME
gnatdoc \- extract documentation from Ada sources
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBgnatdoc\fR \fB\-P\fIproject\fR[\fI.gpr\fR]
.SH DESCRIPTION
GNATdoc is a documentation tool for Ada which processes source files,
extracts documentation directly from the sources, and generates
annotated HTML files. It is based on the source cross\-reference
information (e.g. generated by GNAT for Ada files). This means that
you should ensure that cross\-reference information has been generated
before generating the documentation. It also relies on standard
comments that it extracts from the source code. The engine in charge
of extracting them coupled with the cross\-reference engine gives
GNATdoc all the flexibility needed to generate accurate documentation,
and report errors in case of wrong documentation.
